I'm currently looking for work, either near my neck of the\n          woods or remote, and you can contact me via the links at the bottom of\n          this page.\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"interests\">\n          Besides software, my other interests include:\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Music</strong> is one my greatest passions. I have very\n              eclectic taste and enjoy listening to and talking about all sorts\n              of music. You can be sure to see me setting the mood with my\n              favorite jams, whether I'm working behind a keyboard or cooking up\n              my favorite meals.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Food</strong> makes me happy! Next to nothing puts a\n              bigger smile on my face than sitting down (or standing next to a\n              food truck) and enjoying something I've had 1000 times or never\n              before.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Travel</strong> is something we should all experience. I\n              grew up in a small town and joined the military right out of high\n              school, and the journey I've made to get here now has taught me so\n              much I would've never known. I've travelled numerous states and a\n              few countries so far, and I plan on travelling to many more!\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <strong>Games!</strong> Card games, board games, and video games\n              are a favorite pastime of mine.
