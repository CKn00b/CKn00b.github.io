  <h1>Hello, world! I'm CK New.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer based in Fayetteville, NC. I love building things,
    tinkering with technology, and solving problems with creative thinking is
    what drives me and makes my work enjoyable. I'm currently looking for work,
    either near my neck of the woods or remote, and you can contact me via the
    links at the bottom of this page.
  </p>
  <div class="interests">
    Besides software, my other interests include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Music</strong> is one my greatest passions. I have very eclectic
        taste and enjoy listening to and talking about all sorts of music. You
        can be sure to see me setting the mood with my favorite jams, whether
        I'm working behind a keyboard or cooking up my favorite meals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Food</strong> makes me happy! Next to nothing puts a bigger
        smile on my face than sitting down (or standing next to a food truck)
        and enjoying something I've had 1000 times or never before.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Travel</strong> is something we should all experience. I grew up
        in a small town and joined the military right out of high school, and
        the journey I've made to get here now has taught me so much I would've
        never known. I've travelled numerous states and a few countries so far,
        and I plan on travelling to many more!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Games!</strong> Card games, board games, and video games are a
        favorite pastime of mine. Kicking back and exploring a new world in my
        space ship or playing a few hands of poker has a way of reenergizing and
        refueling me for my next coding session!
      </li>
    </ul>

      >My Learning</a
    >
    <p>
      This is where I keep my day-to-day learning materials and projects. I
      practice coding and building things and keep them here!

      target="_blank"
      class="project-tile"
      >Dataman</a
    >
    <p>
      Dataman was a project I completed using python to replicate a fun little
      calculator (toy?) that makes mathematics fun for (hopefully?) the child
      <em>and</em> parent!
